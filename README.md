# UPDATE: Bluesky is かわいい again, we are so back
**The bot is now offline. Thank you for your service buddy 🫡**

_Are we kawaii yet?_

This repo was for a bot that tracked the Bluesky web repository for the reimplementation of the 'Kawaii Mode' feature. 

The bot posted to Bluesky every 4 hours regarding the status of the feature. 

Upon locating it, it posted an affirmative, updated the local GitHub Pages website, and then shut off.
