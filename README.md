# Are we kawaii yet?

This repo is for a bot that tracks the Bluesky web repository for the reimplementation of the 'Kawaii Mode' feature. The bot posts to Bluesky every 4 hours regarding the status of the feature. Upon locating it, it will post an affirmative, update the local GitHub Pages website, and then shut off.
